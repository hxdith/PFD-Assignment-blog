## **Week 1**:
### Goal: Enhancing OCBC App Accessibility for the Elderly
In our first week of planning, we conducted research to identify common issues faced by the elderly when using applications. These issues include:
- Memory impairments
- Visual impairments
- Auditory impairments
- Limited tech-savviness
- Vulnerability to scams

We set target questions for our research:
- How can we support individuals with memory impairments?
- How can we make the app more user-friendly for those with visual impairments?
- How can we enhance the app's usability for those with limited technology experience?

### Planned Enhancements
We assessed the current features of the OCBC iBanking app and proposed ideas for improvements:

**Current Features:**
- Transfer Money
- Saving Goals
- Card Services

**Our Contributions:**
1. **Enhanced Accessibility**
   - Larger icons and fonts with a screen magnification feature for visual impairments.
   - A screen reader for users with visual impairments.
   - Speech-to-text functionality for users with typing difficulties.
   - Frequently Transferred Accounts feature for those with memory impairments.
   - Schedule Transfer (Repeatable) to assist users with memory impairments.
   - Search feature for simplified navigation.
   - Support for multiple languages, including local languages.
   - Navigation guidance.
   - Enhanced account recovery with a trusted relative's assistance.
   - Improved scam detection with notifications to trusted family members.

### Other Plans
We've chosen to develop our app using ASP.NET due to our team's experience and comfort with this platform.

### Personal Reflection
In this initial meeting for our assignment, we are still uncertain about our project's direction. At this stage, we've outlined plans that seem feasible for us. However, we encountered challenges due to our lack of experience with the OCBC iBanking app, as most of our group members use DBS/POSB. We were reliant on one group member for app information. Future meetings should involve more research to ensure a clearer goal.
## **Week 2**:
### Our current progress:
To begin with, we have decided to name our project the "Type α Project." The Greek letter "α," which is equivalent to the letter "a" in the English alphabet, symbolizes "accessibility." Our slogan can be abbreviated as "TAP." The core concept is to enable the elderly to "TAP into the OCBC banking app" with a strong emphasis on accessibility. We opted for the Greek letter "alpha" because it represents the idea of being "first"; in a similar sense, we aim for our project's top priority to be the elderly.

Considerable thought and care have gone into crafting this slogan, which we find rather appealing and, in retrospect, a noteworthy aspect to share!

After the Q&A session with the OCBC team, we have further narrow our plans:
   - Larger icons and fonts with a screen magnification feature for visual impairments.
   - A screen reader for users with visual impairments.
   - Speech-to-text functionality for users with typing difficulties.
   - Frequently Transferred Accounts feature for those with memory impairments.
   - Schedule Transfer (Repeatable) to assist users with memory impairments.
During our meeting, we have created a trello board to provide updates on the project ~~[here](https://trello.com/invite/b/qjncVdwm/ATTIb4b2e98ddef41dcc3e4dd925dd7166844ED5BD2D/pfd-type-α-project)~~ (link is broken)

We are still in discussion on how to narrow down features specifically made for elderly

### Personal reflection
I  believe we've taken a step forward with our project. We have several ideas in mind, but during our recent meeting, the advice was to focus on tailoring features specifically for the elderly. The challenge lies in the fact that many of the concepts we've brainstormed are actually useful for a broader audience and not just the elderly. So, currently, we find ourselves in a bit of a quandary, trying to pinpoint that one unique and specific feature.

Looking ahead, though, I'm quite optimistic about our progress. Our team has a vision for the website design, database, and code structure that we're building for the future. This gives us a strong foundation to work from, and it's an exciting prospect to see where these ideas will take us.

## Week 3:
For our progress on assignment, we have made some progress. We have a successfully created a database, Models in the website as well as the homepage for the website.  

These are the features we are planning to prioritise before hackathon:
   - 2nd Person Guarantor.
   - Speech-to-text and vice versa.


### Personal Reflection:
I feel this week's sprint was really rough as there was much to do and there is a lack of time. Hackathon is coming soon but there's a lack of time. I have lots of other assignments that I have yet to start.

## Week 4:
An update to the previous week, we have made a skeleton code that is able to fetch and post data on the SQL database. Apart from that, we have also created some HTML pages, and made basic functional webpages link through the use of ASP.net.

Here are the pages we have created this week:
   - Homepage
   - Transfer page
   - Member dashboard
   - All the confirmation pages (e.g payment confirmation)

As for the features, we are in the midst of implementing the 2nd Person Guarantor feature. We are still finding an appropriate emailing service that does not require payment.

### Personal reflection
We have made a decent progress and I feel happy that we have made through this week having some features done. Though, I have still my doubts about achieve our target of implementing the two afforementioned features in week 3. I have responsible for finding a working emailing service and none of them work seamlessly.

 ## Week 5:
 We have successfully created all the necessary webpages for the website and done implementing the 2nd Person Guarantor. We have also decided to push Speech-to-text feature for the final assignment as we are not able to implement it on time though we have the necessary code to get it work but just not the implementation. 

Updated Features of the Website:
   - Transfer page
   - Sign up/login
   - Changing of customer details
   - 2nd Person Guarantor

### Personal Reflection:
Week 5 was one of the most hectic week yet. Juggling multiple assignments was really tough but I am glad we manage to complete the entire website! Unfortunately, we did not implement the text-to-speech due to time contraints. It is also unfortunate that we discovered, on the day of the hackathon, that we do not really need a functional website, as the judges were looking for a front-end design. Though we did not acheieve the requirements but getting to the first checkpoint taught me a lot about teamwork and time management


 ## Week 12:
We attained disappointing results during the hackathon, so this week we focus on planning to implement better features. 

We have discussed with the product owner and come to an agreement on some new additional features part as part of increments and retaining some features:

   - transaction limit,password recovery (implements guarantor)
   - Text-to-speech (both ways)
   - Search bar
   - video tutorials
   - feedback feature
   - frequent recipient list
   - colour-coded transactions
   - improvements to UI/UX

   ### Personal reflection
Quite frankly, I was disappointed that we did not meet the       
requirements. We initially thought the idea would work but it is a shame that it did not despite the amount of effort we have put in. However, it is something that should not set us back. We will continue pouring efforts into completing our work.

## Week 13

For this sprint,  I have partially implemented transaction limit and password recovery.

Just a small description, transaction limit feature implements guarantor feature. whenever a certain transaction done by user is higher than the set limit, it will trigger the 2nd party guarantor. This will be helpful in preventing possible scams, and misinputs by illiterate audience.

As for the password recovery feature, it implements a feature whenever a user forgets password, a guarantor can also help recovering the user's account.

During the meeting we discussed how to also fully integrate the text-to-speech feature into the website.

## Week 14
For this sprint, I have fully implemented transaction limit and password recovery after discovering the bug that was causing the error previous week

I helped my other groupmates with their features as there were overlapping variables and various other errors that cause our code to not run

### Personal reflection
I am quite happy that i managed to get the features working as it was one of the hardest task i faced. I am proud that we manage to almost implement our features despite the assignments piling up.

## Week 15
All features are implemented and everything is completed. Only work remains are to find and fix bugs to make sure our program run just fine.

### personal reflection
I am proud of what my teammates have done. We manage to implement all our features despite the challenges (other modules' project, code issues etc) we faced while trying to get this assignment done. I personally was feeling drained throughout week 15 trying to get everything done on time

### Personal reflection
I had trouble getting the features implemented due to the dependencies (database lacking variables etc) but I am currently in discussions with group members on how to fully implement the features I have coded. I am feeling a bit nervous as I am unsure if I could get all the features done before the deadline.
