## **Week 1** (22/10/2023):
### Goal: Enhancing OCBC App Accessibility for the Elderly
In our first week of planning, we conducted research to identify common issues faced by the elderly when using applications. These issues include:
- Memory impairments
- Visual impairments
- Auditory impairments
- Limited tech-savviness
- Vulnerability to scams

We set target questions for our research:
- How can we support individuals with memory impairments?
- How can we make the app more user-friendly for those with visual impairments?
- How can we enhance the app's usability for those with limited technology experience?

### Planned Enhancements
We assessed the current features of the OCBC iBanking app and proposed ideas for improvements:

**Current Features:**
- Transfer Money
- Saving Goals
- Card Services

**Our Contributions:**
1. **Enhanced Accessibility**
   - Larger icons and fonts with a screen magnification feature for visual impairments.
   - A screen reader for users with visual impairments.
   - Speech-to-text functionality for users with typing difficulties.
   - Frequently Transferred Accounts feature for those with memory impairments.
   - Schedule Transfer (Repeatable) to assist users with memory impairments.
   - Search feature for simplified navigation.
   - Support for multiple languages, including local languages.
   - Navigation guidance.
   - Enhanced account recovery with a trusted relative's assistance.
   - Improved scam detection with notifications to trusted family members.

### Other Plans
We've chosen to develop our app using ASP.NET due to our team's experience and comfort with this platform.

### Personal Reflection
In this initial meeting for our assignment, we are still uncertain about our project's direction. At this stage, we've outlined plans that seem feasible for us. However, we encountered challenges due to our lack of experience with the OCBC iBanking app, as most of our group members use DBS/POSB. We were reliant on one group member for app information. Future meetings should involve more research to ensure a clearer goal.
## **Week 2** (22/10/2023):
### Our current progress:
To begin with, we have decided to name our project the "Type α Project." The Greek letter "α," which is equivalent to the letter "a" in the English alphabet, symbolizes "accessibility." Our slogan can be abbreviated as "TAP." The core concept is to enable the elderly to "TAP into the OCBC banking app" with a strong emphasis on accessibility. We opted for the Greek letter "alpha" because it represents the idea of being "first"; in a similar sense, we aim for our project's top priority to be the elderly.

Considerable thought and care have gone into crafting this slogan, which we find rather appealing and, in retrospect, a noteworthy aspect to share!

After the Q&A session with the OCBC team, we have further narrow our plans:
   - Larger icons and fonts with a screen magnification feature for visual impairments.
   - A screen reader for users with visual impairments.
   - Speech-to-text functionality for users with typing difficulties.
   - Frequently Transferred Accounts feature for those with memory impairments.
   - Schedule Transfer (Repeatable) to assist users with memory impairments.
During our meeting, we have created a trello board to update on the progress regarding the assignment [https://trello.com/invite/b/qjncVdwm/ATTIb4b2e98ddef41dcc3e4dd925dd7166844ED5BD2D/pfd-type-α-project](here)
We are still in discussion on how to narrow down features specifically made for elderly

### Personal reflection
I  believe we've taken a step forward with our project. We have several ideas in mind, but during our recent meeting, the advice was to focus on tailoring features specifically for the elderly. The challenge lies in the fact that many of the concepts we've brainstormed are actually useful for a broader audience and not just the elderly. So, currently, we find ourselves in a bit of a quandary, trying to pinpoint that one unique and specific feature.

Looking ahead, though, I'm quite optimistic about our progress. Our team has a vision for the website design, database, and code structure that we're building for the future. This gives us a strong foundation to work from, and it's an exciting prospect to see where these ideas will take us.
